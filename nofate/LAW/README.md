# LAW

**Immutability Guarantee:**

This directory contains immutable reference documents. Files in LAW/ are frozen once published and must never be modified. Any updates require creating a new versioned file (e.g., IF-v1.md).

**Import Rules:**
- LAW never imports from PROOF
- LAW never imports from IMPLEMENTATIONS
- LAW defines foundational principles and interfaces only
