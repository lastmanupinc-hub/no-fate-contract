            <h2>Purpose of Governance</h2>
            <p>The governance model for the No Fate ecosystem ensures that canonical documents remain stable, verifiable, and trustworthy while allowing for evolution through transparent processes. Governance establishes clear procedures for version creation, community input, and stewardship responsibilities.</p>
            <p>The primary objectives of governance are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain the integrity and immutability of published canonical documents</li>
                <li>Provide transparent processes for proposing and adopting new versions</li>
                <li>Enable community participation while preserving authoritative stewardship</li>
                <li>Ensure cryptographic verification of all canonical documents</li>
                <li>Document decision-making rationale for all version increments</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Governance does not adjudicate interpretive questions, issue rulings, or provide authoritative determinations about specific cases. It maintains boundary classifications as documented standards.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="canonical-documents">
            <h2>Canonical Documents</h2>
            <p>Canonical documents are the authoritative specifications of deterministic boundaries, refusal requirements, and compliance standards within the No Fate ecosystem.</p>
            
            <h3>Immutability</h3>
            <p>Once published, canonical documents are immutable. They cannot be modified, edited, or amended. This immutability ensures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stable reference points for implementers</li>
                <li>Prevention of retroactive changes to published standards</li>
                <li>Cryptographic verifiability through hash consistency</li>
                <li>Clear version history without ambiguity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Changes to canonical content require publishing a new versioned document rather than modifying an existing one.</p>
            
            <h3>Versioning</h3>
            <p>Canonical documents use semantic versioning with the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MAJOR:</strong> Foundational changes or breaking revisions to boundary classifications</li>
                <li><strong>MINOR:</strong> Backward-compatible extensions, supplements, or additional boundary specifications</li>
                <li><strong>PATCH:</strong> Non-substantive corrections such as typographical errors or formatting fixes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each version is a distinct, immutable document with its own cryptographic verification.</p>
            
            <h3>Cryptographic Verification</h3>
            <p>Every canonical document includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SHA-256 Hash:</strong> Verifies document integrity by producing a unique fingerprint. Any modification produces a different hash.</li>
                <li><strong>GPG Signature:</strong> Verifies document authenticity by confirming it was signed by authorized stewards.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Users can independently verify both integrity and authenticity using published hashes and public keys.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="versioning-policy">
            <h2>Versioning Policy</h2>
            <p>The versioning policy governs when and how version numbers are incremented.</p>
            
            <h3>MAJOR Version Increment</h3>
            <p>A MAJOR version increment (e.g., v1.0.0 to v2.0.0) is required when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Foundational boundary classifications are revised or redefined</li>
                <li>Core principles of the framework change in substantive ways</li>
                <li>Breaking changes are introduced that are incompatible with previous versions</li>
                <li>The compliance model undergoes fundamental restructuring</li>
            </ul>
            <p>MAJOR increments are rare and require extensive community review.</p>
            
            <h3>MINOR Version Increment</h3>
            <p>A MINOR version increment (e.g., v1.0.0 to v1.1.0) is appropriate when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>New boundary classifications are added without modifying existing ones</li>
                <li>Domain-specific supplements extend the framework</li>
                <li>Edge cases are clarified or additional refusal conditions are specified</li>
                <li>Backward-compatible enhancements are introduced</li>
            </ul>
            <p>MINOR increments extend the framework without breaking compatibility with previous versions.</p>
            
            <h3>PATCH Version Increment</h3>
            <p>A PATCH version increment (e.g., v1.0.0 to v1.0.1) is used for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Typographical error corrections</li>
                <li>Formatting or stylistic fixes</li>
                <li>Metadata corrections</li>
                <li>Link updates or reference corrections</li>
            </ul>
            <p>PATCH increments do not change substantive content or boundary classifications.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="change-process">
            <h2>Change Process</h2>
            <p>New versions follow a structured process designed to ensure quality, community input, and transparency.</p>

                <li>Appropriate version increment classification</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>5. Publication</h3>
            <p>Upon approval, the new version is published with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Assigned version number</li>
                <li>SHA-256 hash generation</li>
                <li>GPG signature creation</li>

        <section id="non-authority">
            <h2>Non-Authority Statement</h2>
            <p>The No Fate governance process maintains boundary classifications as documented standards. It does not constitute an authoritative body for interpretive or adjudicative determinations.</p>
            
            <h3>What Governance Does</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain canonical documents defining boundary classifications</li>
                <li>Coordinate version proposal and review processes</li>
                <li>Ensure cryptographic verification and immutability</li>
                <li>Facilitate community input and participation</li>
                <li>Document governance decisions transparently</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What Governance Does Not Do</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Interpret laws, regulations, or legal provisions</li>
                <li>Adjudicate disputes or controversies</li>
                <li>Issue rulings or official determinations</li>
                <li>Provide legal advice or guidance</li>
                <li>Exercise discretion over interpretive questions</li>
                <li>Claim authority to resolve nondeterministic questions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Scope of Authority</h3>
            <p>The governance process has authority only over:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Version numbering and publication procedures</li>
                <li>Cryptographic verification infrastructure</li>
                <li>Repository management and access controls</li>
                <li>Community process coordination</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All substantive boundary classifications are subject to community review. The steward does not have unilateral authority to determine what is or is not a deterministic boundary.</p>
