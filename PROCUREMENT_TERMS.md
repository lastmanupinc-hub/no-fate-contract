# PROCUREMENT_TERMS.md

**Status:** DRAFT — AWAITING RATIFICATION  
**Standard:** IF Diamond Standard  
**Scope:** Defines personal procurement constraints

---

## 0. Purpose

This document defines the procurement terms applicable to the author, steward, and originator of IF.

**Its purpose is to:**
- eliminate entitlement ambiguity
- prevent governance pressure
- protect long-term neutrality

---

## 1. Core Rule

**Authorship confers no procurement privilege.**

The author has no special rights to acquire IF.

---

## 2. Identity Irrelevance

At the ledger level:
- the author is indistinguishable from any other participant
- no role, key, or metadata confers advantage
- no "founder" status exists

---

## 3. Exhaustive Procurement Paths

The author may acquire IF only via the same mechanisms available to all participants.

### 3.1 Market Acquisition (Permitted)

- Voluntary exchange
- Purchase
- Services rendered
- Settlement of obligation

**Ledger representation:**
- `TRANSFER_TRANSPARENT`
- `TRANSFER_SHIELDED`

No distinction exists between author and non-author transfers.

### 3.2 Validator Compensation (Not Available in v0)

Under IF v0:
- Fees are burned
- Slashing is burned
- No issuance exists

**Therefore:**
- No validator rewards exist
- The author cannot procure IF via protocol rewards

### 3.3 Conversion or Bridging (Not Available in v0)

- No mint-on-lock
- No proof-of-burn bridge
- No oracle-based conversion

Such mechanisms require explicit supersession.

### 3.4 Genesis Allocation (Forbidden)

- No pre-genesis allocation
- No founder grant
- No reserved supply

**This path is permanently disallowed once genesis is ratified.**

---

## 4. Exhaustiveness Guarantee

**If a procurement path is not listed above, it is invalid.**

---

## 5. Protective Declaration

Any IF held by the author is acquired under the same rules as any other participant and carries no special standing.

---

## 6. Non-Expectation Clause

The author makes no claim to:
- compensation
- appreciation
- governance influence
- protocol rent

**Value arises only from voluntary market behavior.**

---

## 7. Ratification Requirement

This document is binding only when ratified alongside:
- `IF_PROTOCOL_SURFACE_v0`
- `GENESIS_SPEC_v0`

---

## 8. Diamond Statement

**Under IF, authorship creates responsibility, not entitlement.**
