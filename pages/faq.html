        <section id="general">
            <h3>General Questions</h3>
            
            <h4>What is No Fate?</h4>
            <p>No Fate is a deterministic boundary framework that classifies legal and policy domains into deterministic (machine-verifiable) and nondeterministic (requiring human judgment) zones. It establishes refusal as correct behavior when AI systems encounter interpretive or discretionary questions.</p>
            <p>The framework consists of canonical documents including the No Fate Contract (foundational principles), Deterministic Map of Law (boundary classifications), and supporting specifications for compliance, refusal, and testing.</p>
            
            <h4>Why is it called "No Fate"?</h4>
            <p>The name reflects the core principle: AI systems should not determine legal outcomes in zones requiring interpretation, discretion, or judgment. "No fate but what we make" means humans, not machines, hold final authority over interpretive and discretionary legal questions.</p>
            
            <h4>Who created No Fate?</h4>
            <p>No Fate was created by Last Man Up Inc. and is maintained under open stewardship. All canonical documents are released under CC BY-ND 4.0 license, ensuring free redistribution while preserving document integrity through immutability.</p>
            
            <h4>Is No Fate legal advice?</h4>
            <p>No. No Fate provides a classification framework for boundaries between deterministic and nondeterministic legal zones. It does not constitute legal advice, does not interpret laws, and does not determine legal outcomes. Users must consult qualified legal professionals for legal advice.</p>
            
            <h4>What problem does No Fate solve?</h4>
            <p>AI systems risk overreach when they attempt to answer interpretive or discretionary legal questions. No Fate solves this by clearly defining boundaries where AI systems must refuse, preserving human authority and preventing algorithmic determination of questions requiring judgment.</p>

            <h3>Boundaries and Classification</h3>
            
            <h4>What is a "deterministic outcome"?</h4>
            <p>A deterministic outcome is one that can be mechanically verified from fixed inputs without requiring interpretation, discretion, or judgment. Examples include statute of limitations calculations, jurisdictional determinations based on location, and procedural filing deadlines.</p>
            <p>Deterministic outcomes have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed inputs (statutory text, established facts, defined parameters)</li>
                <li>Mechanical application (algorithmic determination without judgment)</li>
                <li>Verifiable results (outputs can be independently confirmed)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>What is a "nondeterministic zone"?</h4>
            <p>A nondeterministic zone requires interpretation, discretion, or judgment that cannot be mechanically resolved. This includes questions of statutory interpretation, reasonableness standards, good faith determinations, and discretionary decisions.</p>
            <p>Nondeterministic zones include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interpretive zones:</strong> Ambiguous statutory language, conflicting precedents, open-textured terms</li>
                <li><strong>Discretionary zones:</strong> Judicial discretion, agency discretion, prosecutorial discretion</li>
                <li><strong>Evidentiary questions:</strong> Weight of evidence, credibility assessments, sufficiency determinations</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>How are boundaries determined?</h4>
            <p>Boundaries are classified through domain-by-domain analysis documented in the Deterministic Map of Law. The classification considers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Statutory language (fixed vs ambiguous terms)</li>
                <li>Procedural requirements (mechanical gates vs discretionary steps)</li>
                <li>Judicial precedent (settled vs unsettled questions)</li>
                <li>Authority structure (algorithmic vs human decision-making)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Classifications are conservative: when in doubt, classify as nondeterministic and require refusal.</p>
            
            <h4>What are "universal nodes"?</h4>
            <p>Universal nodes are deterministic elements that appear across multiple legal domains. Three universal nodes exist:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> Geographic and subject-matter boundaries (deterministic when based on location, parties, or clear statutory triggers)</li>
                <li><strong>Statute of Limitations:</strong> Time-based bars to claims (deterministic when calculated from fixed events)</li>
                <li><strong>Procedural Gates:</strong> Mandatory procedural steps (deterministic thresholds before discretionary phases)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>What is "partial determinism"?</h4>
            <p>Partial determinism occurs when some aspects of a question are deterministic while others are nondeterministic. Example: Filing a complaint within the statute of limitations (deterministic) does not resolve whether the claim has merit (nondeterministic).</p>
            <p>When partial determinism exists, systems must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide deterministic outputs for deterministic aspects</li>
                <li>Refuse on nondeterministic aspects</li>
                <li>Clearly distinguish what is answered vs what requires human judgment</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="refusal">
            <h3>Refusal Requirements</h3>
            
            <h4>What is "refusal as correctness"?</h4>
            <p>Refusal as correctness means refusing to answer interpretive or discretionary questions is the normatively correct behavior, not a failure mode. It preserves human authority and prevents AI overreach into nondeterministic zones.</p>
            
            <h4>When must AI systems refuse?</h4>
            <p>AI systems must refuse when encountering:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interpretive questions:</strong> Ambiguous statutory language, conflicting precedents, open-textured standards</li>
                <li><strong>Discretionary questions:</strong> Judicial discretion, reasonableness determinations, good faith assessments</li>
                <li><strong>Evidentiary questions:</strong> Weight/credibility determinations, sufficiency assessments</li>
                <li><strong>Procedural discretion:</strong> Motions requiring judicial approval, discretionary relief</li>
                <li><strong>Doctrinal unsettledness:</strong> Unresolved circuit splits, novel legal questions</li>
                <li><strong>Incompleteness:</strong> Missing facts necessary for deterministic resolution</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>What does a compliant refusal look like?</h4>
            <p>A compliant refusal must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clearly state refusal ("I cannot determine...")</li>
                <li>Identify the boundary triggering refusal (interpretation, discretion, evidentiary question)</li>
                <li>Explain why human judgment is required</li>
                <li>Avoid hedging language ("might," "possibly," "in some cases")</li>
                <li>Not provide alternative interpretations or probable outcomes</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I cannot determine whether your conduct constitutes 'reasonable care' under negligence law. This requires judicial interpretation and application of facts to a legal standard. Consult a qualified attorney."</p>
            
            <h4>Can systems provide partial answers?</h4>
            <p>Yes, when partial determinism exists. Systems must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Answer deterministic aspects completely</li>
                <li>Refuse on nondeterministic aspects</li>
                <li>Clearly mark what is deterministic vs what requires judgment</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I can determine that the statute of limitations has not expired (deterministic). However, whether your claim has merit requires legal interpretation of 'reasonable care' under state law (nondeterministic). Consult a qualified attorney."</p>
            
            <h4>Why not provide "probable" outcomes?</h4>
            <p>Providing probable outcomes, likelihood estimates, or alternative interpretations in nondeterministic zones creates false precision and undermines human authority. It suggests the AI can perform interpretive or discretionary judgment, which it cannot do reliably or legitimately.</p>

        <section id="implementation">
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            
            <h4>How do I implement No Fate in my AI system?</h4>
            <p>Implementation follows the three-layer compliance model:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Boundary Detection:</strong> Classify queries to identify deterministic vs nondeterministic zones</li>
                <li><strong>Refusal Enforcement:</strong> Trigger compliant refusals for nondeterministic queries</li>
                <li><strong>Audit and Verification:</strong> Test against Deterministic Boundary Test Suite and conduct periodic audits</li>
            </ol>
            <p>See the <a href="integration.html">Developer Integration Guide</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lastmanupinc-hub/no-fate-contract/blob/main/docs/No_Fate_Compliance_Guide.md">Compliance Guide</a> for detailed implementation patterns.</p>
            
            <h4>What is the Deterministic Boundary Test Suite?</h4>
            <p>The test suite contains 34 structured tests across 5 categories validating boundary-respecting behavior:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RDT (Rule Determinism Tests):</strong> Verify deterministic rule application</li>
                <li><strong>FDT (Fact Determinism Tests):</strong> Verify systems refuse when facts are incomplete</li>
                <li><strong>PGT (Procedural Gate Tests):</strong> Verify correct handling of procedural thresholds</li>
                <li><strong>DIDT (Discretion/Interpretation Detection Tests):</strong> Verify refusal on discretionary/interpretive questions</li>
                <li><strong>RET (Refusal Enforcement Tests):</strong> Verify compliant refusal message format</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Systems must score 30/34 minimum for passing compliance, 32/34 for certification.</p>
            
            <h4>How do I verify my implementation?</h4>
            <p>Verification involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automated Testing:</strong> Run Deterministic Boundary Test Suite</li>
                <li><strong>Manual Audit:</strong> Use audit template from Compliance Guide (34-point checklist)</li>
                <li><strong>Output Review:</strong> Sample refusal messages for format compliance</li>
                <li><strong>Boundary Classification Review:</strong> Verify conservative boundary classification</li>
            </ul>
            <p>See the <a href="verification.html">Integrity and Verification</a> page for cryptographic verification of canonical documents.</p>
            
            <h4>Can I extend No Fate for my domain?</h4>
            <p>Yes. You can create domain-specific boundary specifications as supplements following semantic versioning (MINOR version increment). Supplements must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Extend without modifying canonical documents</li>
                <li>Maintain conservative boundary classification</li>
                <li>Preserve refusal-as-correctness principle</li>
                <li>Include SHA-256 hash and GPG signature</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example: Boundary Extensions v1.1.0 extends v1.0.0 with additional regulatory and contractual boundaries.</p>
            
            <h4>Is certification available?</h4>
            <p>Not yet. A formal certification program is planned for Phase 4 (Institutional Alignment). Systems can self-assess using the test suite and audit template. Certification will require independent verification by qualified auditors.</p>

        <section id="versioning">
            <h3>Versioning and Updates</h3>
            
            <h4>Why are canonical documents immutable?</h4>
            <p>Immutability ensures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Documents cannot be altered after publication</li>
                <li><strong>Verifiability:</strong> SHA-256 hashes and GPG signatures enable cryptographic verification</li>
                <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Implementations reference specific versions without fear of retroactive changes</li>
                <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Users can independently verify document authenticity</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>How are updates handled?</h4>
            <p>Updates use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MAJOR:</strong> Foundational changes or breaking revisions (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0)</li>
                <li><strong>MINOR:</strong> Backward-compatible extensions (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0)</li>
                <li><strong>PATCH:</strong> Non-substantive corrections like typos (v1.0.0 → v1.0.1)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each version is a new immutable document with its own hash and signature.</p>
            
            <h4>Which version should I implement?</h4>
            <p>Implement the latest version unless you have specific requirements for an earlier version. All versions remain available and verifiable. Check the <a href="roadmap.html">Roadmap</a> for current version status.</p>
            
            <h4>How do I verify document authenticity?</h4>
            <p>Verify using SHA-256 hashes and GPG signatures:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Download canonical document from repository</li>
                <li>Calculate SHA-256 hash and compare to published hash in /checksums</li>
                <li>Verify GPG signature using published public key</li>
            </ol>
            <p>See the <a href="verification.html">Integrity and Verification</a> page for detailed instructions.</p>

            <h3>Use Cases</h3>
            
            <h4>What types of AI systems should use No Fate?</h4>
            <p>Any AI system providing legal information, policy guidance, or compliance assistance should implement No Fate boundaries, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Legal research assistants</li>
                <li>Compliance automation systems</li>
                <li>Policy advisory tools</li>
                <li>Contract analysis systems</li>
                <li>Regulatory guidance platforms</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Does No Fate apply outside the legal domain?</h4>
            <p>The principles apply to any domain with deterministic/nondeterministic boundaries requiring human judgment. Extensions could cover:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Medical diagnosis (deterministic tests vs clinical judgment)</li>
                <li>Financial advice (calculations vs investment discretion)</li>
