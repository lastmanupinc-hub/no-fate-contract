            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The integrity and authenticity of canonical documents are essential to the No Fate framework. Users must be able to verify independently that documents have not been altered and that they originate from authorized stewards.</p>
            <p>This page explains how to verify canonical documents using cryptographic methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SHA-256 hashing</strong> verifies that a document has not been modified (integrity).</li>
                <li><strong>GPG signatures</strong> verify that a document was signed by an authorized steward (authenticity).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both methods are industry-standard cryptographic techniques. They do not require trust in third parties—verification is performed entirely on your local system.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="canonical-definition">
            <h2>What "Canonical" Means</h2>
            <p>A <strong>canonical document</strong> is an official, authoritative version of a No Fate specification. Canonical documents are immutable once published. They serve as stable reference points for implementers, auditors, and compliance assessments.</p>
            
            <h3>Characteristics of Canonical Documents</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Immutable:</strong> Once published, they cannot be modified. Changes require publishing a new versioned document.</li>
                <li><strong>Versioned:</strong> Each canonical document has a semantic version number (e.g., v1.0.0).</li>
                <li><strong>Cryptographically Verified:</strong> Each document includes a SHA-256 hash and may include a GPG signature.</li>
                <li><strong>Publicly Accessible:</strong> Canonical documents are freely available for download and verification.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Why Verification Matters</h3>
            <p>Verification ensures that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The document you downloaded is identical to the published canonical version.</li>
                <li>No alterations occurred during transmission or storage.</li>
                <li>The document originates from authorized stewards, not a malicious third party.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Without verification, you cannot be certain that a document is authentic or unaltered.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="sha256-verification">
            <h2>SHA-256 Hash Verification</h2>
            <p>SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a unique 64-character fingerprint for any file. If even a single character changes, the hash will be completely different.</p>
            
            <h3>How SHA-256 Verification Works</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The steward computes the SHA-256 hash of the canonical document and publishes it alongside the document.</li>
                <li>You download the document and compute its SHA-256 hash on your local system.</li>
                <li>You compare your computed hash with the published hash. If they match, the document is authentic and unaltered.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
            
            <h4>Step 1: Obtain the Published Hash</h4>
            <p>Find the published SHA-256 hash for the canonical document. This is typically provided in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The document's metadata section</li>
                <li>A <code>checksums.txt</code> file in the repository</li>
                <li>Release notes or documentation pages</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example published hash:</p>
            <pre><code>abc123def456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789  No_Fate_Contract_v1_0_0.md</code></pre>
            
            <h4>Step 2: Download the Canonical Document</h4>
            <p>Download the canonical document from the official repository or website. Ensure you are downloading from a trusted source.</p>
            
            <h4>Step 3: Compute the SHA-256 Hash</h4>
            <p>Use a command-line tool to compute the hash of the downloaded file.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Using <code>sha256sum</code>:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>sha256sum No_Fate_Contract_v1_0_0.md</code></pre>
            
            <p><strong>Using <code>shasum</code>:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>shasum -a 256 No_Fate_Contract_v1_0_0.md</code></pre>
            
            <p><strong>Using PowerShell:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 No_Fate_Contract_v1_0_0.md</code></pre>
            
            <p>The command will output a 64-character hexadecimal string.</p>
            
            <h4>Step 4: Compare the Hashes</h4>
            <p>Compare the hash you computed with the published hash:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>If the hashes match:</strong> The document is authentic and unaltered. You can trust its contents.</li>
                <li><strong>If the hashes do not match:</strong> The document has been modified or corrupted. Do not trust it. Download a fresh copy from the official source and verify again.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Example Verification</h3>
            <p>Suppose the published hash is:</p>
            <pre><code>abc123def456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789</code></pre>
            
            <p>You compute the hash of your downloaded file:</p>
            <pre><code>$ sha256sum No_Fate_Contract_v1_0_0.md
abc123def456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789  No_Fate_Contract_v1_0_0.md</code></pre>
            
            <p>The hashes match. The document is verified.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="gpg-verification">
            <h2>Optional GPG Signature Verification</h2>
            <p>GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) signatures provide an additional layer of verification by confirming that a document was signed by an authorized steward's private key.</p>
            
            <h3>How GPG Verification Works</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The steward signs the canonical document using their private GPG key, generating a <code>.sig</code> signature file.</li>
                <li>The steward publishes their public GPG key, which anyone can obtain.</li>
                <li>You download the document, the signature file, and the public key.</li>
                <li>You use GPG to verify that the signature matches the document and was created by the steward's private key.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Why Use GPG Signatures?</h3>
            <p>GPG signatures verify authenticity in addition to integrity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>SHA-256 verifies the document has not been altered.</li>
                <li>GPG verifies the document was signed by a specific authorized steward.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If a malicious actor creates a fake document and publishes a fake hash, GPG verification will fail because they do not possess the steward's private key.</p>
            
            <h3>High-Level GPG Verification Steps</h3>
            
            <h4>Step 1: Obtain the Steward's Public Key</h4>
            <p>Download the steward's public GPG key from the official repository or keyserver. Example key ID: <code>&lt;KEYID&gt;</code>.</p>
            <pre><code>gpg --recv-keys &lt;KEYID&gt;</code></pre>
            
            <h4>Step 2: Download the Signature File</h4>
            <p>Signature files typically have a <code>.sig</code> extension. Example:</p>
            <pre><code>No_Fate_Contract_v1_0_0.md.sig</code></pre>
            
            <h4>Step 3: Verify the Signature</h4>
            <p>Use GPG to verify the signature against the document:</p>
            <pre><code>gpg --verify No_Fate_Contract_v1_0_0.md.sig No_Fate_Contract_v1_0_0.md</code></pre>
            
            <p>If verification succeeds, GPG will output a message indicating a good signature from the steward's key:</p>
            <pre><code>gpg: Good signature from "No Fate Steward &lt;email@example.org&gt;" [ultimate]</code></pre>
            
            <p>If verification fails, GPG will indicate a bad signature or that the signature does not match the document.</p>
            
            <h3>Trust and Key Management</h3>
            <p>GPG verification depends on obtaining the correct public key. Ensure you download the key from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The official No Fate repository</li>
                <li>Trusted keyservers</li>
                <li>Multiple independent sources (to cross-verify)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Be cautious of keys obtained from unverified sources.</p>

        <section id="checksums-files">
            <h2>Checksums Files</h2>
            <p>A checksums file (often named <code>checksums.txt</code> or <code>SHA256SUMS</code>) contains SHA-256 hashes for multiple canonical documents in a single file. This simplifies verification when multiple documents are published together.</p>
            
            <h3>Format</h3>
            <p>A typical checksums file contains one line per document:</p>
            <pre><code>abc123def456...  No_Fate_Contract_v1_0_0.md
def456abc789...  Deterministic_Map_of_Law_v1_0_0.md
789abc123def...  AI_Refusal_Specification_v1_0_0.md</code></pre>
            
            <p>Each line contains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The 64-character SHA-256 hash</li>
                <li>Two spaces</li>
                <li>The filename</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Using Checksums Files</h3>
            
            <h4>Verify All Documents at Once</h4>
            <p>If you have downloaded multiple canonical documents, you can verify all of them using the checksums file:</p>
            <pre><code>sha256sum -c checksums.txt</code></pre>
            
            <p>This command checks each file listed in the checksums file and reports whether each hash matches:</p>
            <pre><code>No_Fate_Contract_v1_0_0.md: OK
Deterministic_Map_of_Law_v1_0_0.md: OK
AI_Refusal_Specification_v1_0_0.md: OK</code></pre>
            
            <h4>Verify a Single Document</h4>
            <p>If you only want to verify one document, you can extract its hash from the checksums file and compare manually, or use:</p>
            <pre><code>grep No_Fate_Contract_v1_0_0.md checksums.txt | sha256sum -c</code></pre>
            
            <h3>Verifying the Checksums File Itself</h3>
            <p>The checksums file may itself be GPG-signed to ensure its authenticity. If a <code>checksums.txt.sig</code> file is provided, verify it using GPG:</p>
            <pre><code>gpg --verify checksums.txt.sig checksums.txt</code></pre>
            
            <p>This confirms that the checksums file was created by an authorized steward.</p>

        <section id="guarantees-limitations">
            <h2>Integrity Guarantees and Limitations</h2>
            
            <h3>What Verification Guarantees</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> SHA-256 verification guarantees that the document has not been altered since the hash was computed.</li>
                <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> GPG verification guarantees that the document was signed by the holder of the private key corresponding to the published public key.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Verification ensures that all users referencing the same version number are using identical documents.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What Verification Does Not Guarantee</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Correctness:</strong> Verification does not guarantee that the content of the document is correct, complete, or suitable for your use case.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Verification does not confirm that implementing the framework satisfies any legal or regulatory requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Security of Distribution Channels:</strong> Verification does not protect against man-in-the-middle attacks if you obtain the hash or public key from a compromised source. Always obtain verification materials from trusted, independent channels.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Best Practices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Always verify canonical documents before implementation or citation.</li>
                <li>Obtain hashes and public keys from multiple independent sources when possible.</li>
                <li>Store verified canonical documents securely to avoid re-downloading unverified copies.</li>
                <li>Re-verify documents periodically if they are stored long-term.</li>
                <li>Use both SHA-256 and GPG verification when both are available for maximum assurance.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Reporting Verification Failures</h3>
            <p>If verification fails:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not use the document.</li>
                <li>Download a fresh copy from the official repository.</li>
                <li>Verify the fresh copy using published hashes and signatures.</li>
                <li>If verification continues to fail, contact the stewards to report a potential integrity issue.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Persistent verification failures may indicate a compromised distribution channel, corrupted files, or tampering.</p>
