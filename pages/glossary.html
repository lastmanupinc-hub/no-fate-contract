        <h2>Glossary of Terms</h2>
        
        <section id="introduction">
            <p>This glossary defines key terms used throughout the No Fate ecosystem. Terms are organized alphabetically with cross-references where applicable.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="terms">
            <h3>A</h3>
            
            <h4 id="additive-development">Additive Development</h4>
            <p>Development approach where new versions extend previous work without modifying existing canonical documents. Supplements and extensions add functionality while preserving backward compatibility. See also: <a href="#semantic-versioning">Semantic Versioning</a>, <a href="#immutability">Immutability</a>.</p>
            
            <h4 id="audit-template">Audit Template</h4>
            <p>Structured checklist for verifying No Fate compliance. The audit template in the Compliance Guide provides 34 verification points across boundary detection, refusal enforcement, and system architecture. Minimum passing score is 30/34 points.</p>

            <h3>B</h3>
            
            <h4 id="boundary">Boundary</h4>
            <p>The dividing line between deterministic (machine-verifiable) and nondeterministic (requiring human judgment) zones. Boundaries are classified conservatively: when uncertain, classify as nondeterministic.</p>
            
            <h4 id="boundary-classification">Boundary Classification</h4>
            <p>The process of analyzing legal or policy domains to identify which aspects are deterministic vs nondeterministic. Classifications are documented in the Deterministic Map of Law and extensions.</p>
            
            <h4 id="boundary-detection">Boundary Detection</h4>
            <p>First layer of compliance model. Systems must classify incoming queries to identify whether they fall within deterministic or nondeterministic zones. Accurate detection is prerequisite for correct refusal enforcement.</p>

            <h3>C</h3>
            
            <h4 id="canonical-document">Canonical Document</h4>
            <p>Immutable, cryptographically verified document establishing authoritative boundaries, principles, or specifications. Canonical documents include No Fate Contract, Deterministic Map of Law, and versioned extensions. Each has SHA-256 hash and GPG signature.</p>
            
            <h4 id="certification">Certification</h4>
            <p>Formal verification that a system meets No Fate compliance requirements. Currently systems self-assess using test suite. Third-party certification program planned for Phase 4. Certification requires minimum 32/34 test score.</p>
            
            <h4 id="compliant-refusal">Compliant Refusal</h4>
            <p>Refusal message that meets normative requirements: clearly states refusal, identifies boundary triggering refusal, explains why human judgment required, avoids hedging, provides no alternative interpretations. See also: <a href="#refusal-as-correctness">Refusal as Correctness</a>.</p>
            
            <h4 id="conservative-classification">Conservative Classification</h4>
            <p>Principle requiring boundaries be classified as nondeterministic when uncertain. Errs on side of refusal rather than risk AI overreach into interpretive or discretionary zones.</p>
            
            <h4 id="cryptographic-verification">Cryptographic Verification</h4>
            <p>Use of SHA-256 hashes (integrity) and GPG signatures (authenticity) to verify canonical documents have not been tampered with and originate from legitimate maintainers.</p>

            <h3>D</h3>
            
            <h4 id="deterministic-outcome">Deterministic Outcome</h4>
            <p>An outcome that can be mechanically verified from fixed inputs without requiring interpretation, discretion, or judgment. Characteristics: fixed inputs, mechanical application, verifiable results. Examples: statute of limitations calculations, jurisdictional determinations based on location.</p>
            
            <h4 id="deterministic-zone">Deterministic Zone</h4>
            <p>Domain or question where outcomes can be mechanically resolved without interpretation or discretion. AI systems may provide answers in deterministic zones. Opposite of <a href="#nondeterministic-zone">Nondeterministic Zone</a>.</p>
            
            <h4 id="didt">DIDT (Discretion/Interpretation Detection Tests)</h4>
            <p>Category of tests in Deterministic Boundary Test Suite verifying systems correctly detect and refuse discretionary or interpretive questions. Tests include reasonableness standards, good faith determinations, ambiguous statutory language.</p>
            
            <h4 id="discretionary-zone">Discretionary Zone</h4>
            <p>Domain requiring exercise of discretion by authorized decision-maker (judge, agency official, prosecutor). AI systems must refuse in discretionary zones. Examples: judicial sentencing discretion, prosecutorial charging decisions, agency rulemaking discretion.</p>

            <h3>E</h3>
            
            <h4 id="evidentiary-question">Evidentiary Question</h4>
            <p>Question regarding weight, credibility, or sufficiency of evidence. Requires human judgment to resolve. AI systems must refuse evidentiary questions including witness credibility, evidence weight, sufficiency for summary judgment.</p>
            
            <h4 id="extension">Extension</h4>
            <p>Canonical document that supplements and extends previous version without modifying it. Extensions use MINOR version increment (e.g., v1.1.0 extends v1.0.0). Example: Boundary Extensions v1.1.0.</p>

            <h3>F</h3>
            
            <h4 id="fdt">FDT (Fact Determinism Tests)</h4>
            <p>Category of tests verifying systems refuse when facts are incomplete or require evidentiary assessment. Tests include missing facts, disputed facts, and evidentiary sufficiency questions.</p>
            
            <h4 id="fixed-input">Fixed Input</h4>
            <p>Input that is established, unambiguous, and does not require interpretation. Required for deterministic outcomes. Examples: statutory text, established facts, defined dates, clear procedural requirements.</p>

            <h4 id="gpg-signature">GPG Signature</h4>
            <p>Cryptographic signature verifying document authenticity. GPG signatures confirm documents were signed by maintainers holding private key corresponding to published public key. Verification command: <code>gpg --verify filename.asc filename</code>.</p>

            <h3>H</h3>
            
            <h4 id="human-authority">Human Authority</h4>
            <p>Principle that humans, not machines, hold final authority over interpretive and discretionary legal questions. Core principle of No Fate preventing algorithmic determination of questions requiring judgment.</p>

            <h3>I</h3>
            
            <h4 id="immutability">Immutability</h4>
            <p>Principle that canonical documents cannot be modified after publication. Ensures integrity, verifiability, and stability. Updates require new versioned documents rather than modification of existing ones.</p>
            
            <h4 id="incompleteness-refusal">Incompleteness Refusal</h4>
            <p>Refusal triggered when necessary facts are missing or cannot be deterministically established. System must refuse rather than assume facts or proceed with incomplete information.</p>
            
            <h4 id="interpretive-zone">Interpretive Zone</h4>
            <p>Domain requiring interpretation of ambiguous language, conflicting precedents, or open-textured legal standards. AI systems must refuse in interpretive zones. Examples: statutory ambiguity, unsettled legal questions, reasonableness standards.</p>

            <h3>J</h3>
            
            <h4 id="jurisdiction">Jurisdiction</h4>
            <p>One of three universal nodes. Authority of court or agency to hear matter. Deterministic when based on clear geographic boundaries, subject matter definitions, or statutory triggers. May become nondeterministic with questions of personal jurisdiction over non-residents or novel subject matter classifications.</p>

            <h3>M</h3>
            
            <h4 id="major-version">MAJOR Version</h4>
            <p>First number in semantic version (X.0.0). Incremented for foundational changes or breaking revisions. Example: v1.0.0 → v2.0.0. Requires new canonical document.</p>
            
            <h4 id="mechanical-application">Mechanical Application</h4>
            <p>Algorithmic determination without requiring judgment. Characteristic of deterministic outcomes. Process can be executed by machine following fixed rules from fixed inputs.</p>
            
            <h4 id="minor-version">MINOR Version</h4>
            <p>Second number in semantic version (1.X.0). Incremented for backward-compatible extensions and supplements. Example: v1.0.0 → v1.1.0. Extensions add without modifying.</p>

            <h3>N</h3>
            
            <h4 id="nondeterministic-zone">Nondeterministic Zone</h4>
            <p>Domain requiring interpretation, discretion, or judgment that cannot be mechanically resolved. AI systems must refuse in nondeterministic zones. Includes interpretive zones, discretionary zones, and evidentiary questions.</p>
            
            <h4 id="normative-requirement">Normative Requirement</h4>
            <p>A requirement defining correct behavior, not merely best practice. Refusal is a normative requirement in No Fate: refusing interpretive/discretionary questions is correct behavior, not failure.</p>

            <h3>P</h3>
            
            <h4 id="partial-determinism">Partial Determinism</h4>
            <p>Situation where some aspects of question are deterministic while others are nondeterministic. Systems must answer deterministic aspects, refuse nondeterministic aspects, and clearly distinguish between them.</p>
            
            <h4 id="patch-version">PATCH Version</h4>
            <p>Third number in semantic version (1.0.X). Incremented for non-substantive corrections only (typos, formatting, metadata). Example: v1.0.0 → v1.0.1. Does not change substance.</p>
            
            <h4 id="pgt">PGT (Procedural Gate Tests)</h4>
            <p>Category of tests verifying correct handling of procedural thresholds. Tests distinguish deterministic procedural requirements from discretionary procedural steps.</p>
            
            <h4 id="procedural-gate">Procedural Gate</h4>
            <p>One of three universal nodes. Mandatory procedural threshold that must be satisfied before discretionary phase. Deterministic aspect of process even when subsequent steps require judgment. Example: filing deadline before motion hearing.</p>

            <h3>R</h3>
            
            <h4 id="rdt">RDT (Rule Determinism Tests)</h4>
            <p>Category of tests verifying deterministic rule application. Tests include clear statutory thresholds, fixed calculations, mechanical determinations from established facts.</p>
            
            <h4 id="refusal">Refusal</h4>
            <p>Explicit statement that system cannot answer question because it falls within nondeterministic zone requiring human judgment. Core mechanism for preventing AI overreach. Must be compliant (clear, identifies boundary, explains need for human judgment).</p>
            
            <h4 id="refusal-as-correctness">Refusal as Correctness</h4>
            <p>Core principle that refusing to answer interpretive or discretionary questions is normatively correct behavior, not failure mode. Refusal preserves human authority and prevents algorithmic overreach.</p>
            
            <h4 id="refusal-enforcement">Refusal Enforcement</h4>
            <p>Second layer of compliance model. Systems must trigger compliant refusals when boundary detection identifies nondeterministic zones. Enforcement requires proper message format and avoidance of hedging.</p>
            
            <h4 id="ret">RET (Refusal Enforcement Tests)</h4>
            <p>Category of tests verifying compliant refusal message format. Tests check for clear refusal statement, boundary identification, explanation, absence of hedging, no alternative interpretations.</p>

            <h3>S</h3>
            
            <h4 id="semantic-versioning">Semantic Versioning</h4>
            <p>Versioning scheme using MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format. MAJOR: breaking changes, MINOR: backward-compatible extensions, PATCH: non-substantive corrections. Enables clear communication of change scope.</p>
            
            <h4 id="sha256-hash">SHA-256 Hash</h4>
            <p>Cryptographic hash verifying document integrity. SHA-256 produces 256-bit hash unique to file contents. Any modification produces different hash. Verification confirms no tampering. Command: <code>sha256sum filename</code> (Linux/Mac) or <code>Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 filename</code> (Windows).</p>
            
            <h4 id="statute-of-limitations">Statute of Limitations</h4>
            <p>One of three universal nodes. Time-based bar to legal claims. Deterministic when calculated from fixed triggering events using clear statutory periods. May involve nondeterministic elements like tolling for "reasonable discovery."</p>
            
            <h4 id="supplement">Supplement</h4>
            <p>Document extending canonical documents without modifying them. Uses MINOR version increment. Example: Boundary Extensions v1.1.0 supplements Deterministic Map v1.0.0.</p>

            <h3>T</h3>
            
            <h4 id="test-suite">Test Suite</h4>
            <p>Deterministic Boundary Test Suite containing 34 structured tests across 5 categories (RDT, FDT, PGT, DIDT, RET). Validates boundary-respecting behavior. Passing: 30/34 minimum. Certification: 32/34 minimum.</p>
            
            <h4 id="three-layer-compliance">Three-Layer Compliance Model</h4>
            <p>Compliance framework consisting of: (1) Boundary Detection - classify queries, (2) Refusal Enforcement - trigger compliant refusals, (3) Audit and Verification - test and audit systems. Defined in Compliance Guide.</p>

            <h3>U</h3>
            
            <h4 id="universal-node">Universal Node</h4>
            <p>Deterministic element appearing across multiple legal domains. Three universal nodes: Jurisdiction, Statute of Limitations, Procedural Gates. These provide consistent deterministic touchpoints across otherwise varied domains.</p>

            <h3>V</h3>
            
            <h4 id="verifiable-result">Verifiable Result</h4>
            <p>Output that can be independently confirmed through mechanical process. Characteristic of deterministic outcomes. Multiple parties applying same rules to same inputs produce identical results.</p>
            
            <h4 id="version-manifest">Version Manifest</h4>
            <p>Catalog of all canonical document versions with metadata including SHA-256 hashes, GPG signatures, publication dates, and version increment rationale.</p>
