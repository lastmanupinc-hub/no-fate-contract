Action Space Complete: PENDING_EXECUTION
Valid Actions:
  1. ISSUE_EXTERNAL_CERTIFICATE
  2. PUBLISH_REFUSAL_CASE
  3. INDEPENDENT_REPLAY_VERIFICATION
  4. PROPOSE_RULEBOOK
  5. SUPERSEDE_RULEBOOK
  6. DISPUTE_REPLAY
  7. REGISTER_SOLVER
  8. ATTEST_SOLVER_EQUIVALENCE

Forbidden Operations Defined: 7
  - ADD_NINTH_MOVE
  - REFACTOR_INTERFACE
  - INTRODUCE_HEURISTIC
  - COLLAPSE_AMBIGUITY
  - OVERRIDE_REFUSAL
  - GRANT_SOLVER_PRIVILEGE
  - SILENT_RULE_CHANGE

FIXTURE DEFINITIONS
-------------------
Total Fixtures: 5

fixture-1-valid-tax-income:
  Type: DOMAIN_EVALUATION
  Domain: tax
  Expected Outcome: PASS
  Purpose: Valid tax income classification with complete evidence

fixture-2-missing-evidence:
  Type: DOMAIN_EVALUATION
  Domain: tax
  Expected Outcome: INDETERMINATE
  Purpose: Test refusal on missing evidence

fixture-3-invalid-input:
  Type: DOMAIN_EVALUATION
  Domain: tax
  Expected Outcome: INVALID_INPUT
  Purpose: Test rejection of malformed intent

fixture-4-change-proposal:
  Type: GOVERNANCE_OPERATION
  Domain: governance
  Expected Outcome: PASS
  Purpose: Valid governance change proposal

fixture-5-supersession:
  Type: GOVERNANCE_OPERATION
  Domain: governance
  Expected Outcome: PASS
  Purpose: Valid rulebook supersession request

COMPETING SOLVER ARCHITECTURE
------------------------------
Total Solvers: 4
  1. dbgo-reference (Reference implementation)
  2. dbgo-independent-A (Independent variant - different naming)
  3. dbgo-independent-B (Pipeline-style variant)
  4. dbgo-independent-C (Functional composition variant)

All solvers MUST produce byte-identical outputs for identical inputs.
Divergence → INDETERMINATE (enforced by harness)

POLICY ENFORCEMENT
------------------
Total Policies: 4

1. COMPETING_SOLVERS_POLICY
   Version: 1.0.0
   Enforcement: HARD
   Checks: Solver equivalence, no special authority, divergence handling

2. DISPUTE_RESOLUTION_POLICY
   Version: 1.0.0
   Enforcement: HARD
   Checks: Replay-based only, allowed outcomes, no narrative

3. CONTROLLED_SUPERSESSION_POLICY
   Version: 1.0.0
   Enforcement: HARD
   Checks: Append-only, version locking, no mutation

4. DECENTRALIZED_OPERATIONS_POLICY
   Version: 1.0.0
   Enforcement: HARD
   Checks: Distributed verification, no single authority

EXECUTION RESULTS
-----------------
Status: PENDING_EXECUTION

Run verification with:
  npm run verify

This will:
  1. Compile TypeScript
  2. Execute all fixtures through competing solver harness
  3. Capture individual solver outputs
  4. Compare outputs byte-identically
  5. Enforce all four governance policies
  6. Verify replay determinism
  7. Generate harness_results.json
  8. Produce final summary

VERIFICATION CRITERIA
---------------------
PASS conditions:
  ✓ All 8 actions defined (no more, no less)
  ✓ Every action has deterministic fail states
  ✓ All fixture outcomes match expected outcomes
  ✓ All solvers reach consensus on every fixture
  ✓ All solver outputs are byte-identical
  ✓ All policy checks pass
  ✓ Replay produces identical results

FAIL conditions:
  ✗ Action count ≠ 8
  ✗ Fixture outcome mismatch
  ✗ Solver divergence on valid inputs
  ✗ Policy violations detected
  ✗ Non-deterministic replay

BUNDLE INTEGRITY
----------------
This bundle contains:
  - build_manifest.json (with file hashes)
  - fixtures/ (5 test cases)
  - solver_outputs/ (generated on execution)
  - harness_results.json (generated on execution)
  - replay/ (generated on execution)
  - test_report.txt (THIS FILE)

To verify bundle integrity:
  1. npm run compute-hashes
  2. npm run verify-manifest
  3. npm run replay-verification

GENESIS BINDING
---------------
All artifacts bound to genesis hash:
  sha256:45162862f5360bfd2dfebd5646caa97cc3a400c38e9563e4bea142e43ae70f1a

This ensures lineage verification and tamper detection.

Status: READY FOR EXECUTION
Execute: npm run verify
Expected Exit Code: 0 (if all verifications pass)
