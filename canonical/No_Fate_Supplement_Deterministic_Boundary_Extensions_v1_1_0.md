# ABSTRACT

This supplement extends the deterministic boundary classifications established in The No Fate Contract v1.0.0 and The Deterministic Map of Law v1.0.0. It does not modify, contradict, or replace those documents. It provides additional deterministic classifications, clarifies edge cases, and identifies newly recognized refusal conditions.

All principles from v1.0.0 documents remain authoritative. This supplement operates within the established framework and expands it only where determinism is structurally verifiable.

# PART I — PURPOSE AND SCOPE

## 1. Purpose of This Supplement

This supplement serves four functions:

1. **Extend Deterministic Classifications** — Identify additional domains where determinism is structurally possible.
2. **Clarify Edge Cases** — Define boundary conditions that were implicit in v1.0.0 but not explicitly enumerated.
3. **Expand Refusal Conditions** — Identify additional scenarios where deterministic systems must refuse to produce outputs.
4. **Preserve v1.0.0 Integrity** — Ensure no contradiction or modification of canonical v1.0.0 documents.

## 2. Relationship to v1.0.0 Documents

This supplement is **additive only**. It:

- Does not alter any v1.0.0 classifications
- Does not reinterpret v1.0.0 language
- Does not contradict v1.0.0 principles
- Does not replace v1.0.0 documents

If any conflict arises between this supplement and v1.0.0 documents, the v1.0.0 documents control.

## 3. Scope Limitations

This supplement does not:

- Interpret law
- Adjudicate outcomes
- Provide legal advice
- Replace human judgment
- Expand into nondeterministic domains

All extensions are limited to deterministic boundary identification.

# PART II — EXTENDED DETERMINISTIC CLASSIFICATIONS

## 4. Regulatory Compliance Thresholds

### 4.1 Numeric Reporting Triggers

Deterministic when:

- Threshold values are explicit in regulation
- Reporting obligations are binary (trigger or no trigger)
- No discretionary evaluation is required
- Factual inputs are complete and unambiguous

**Examples:**
- SEC filing deadlines based on asset size
- Environmental reporting thresholds for emissions
- Tax withholding calculations based on numeric income brackets

### 4.2 Date-Based Compliance Triggers

Deterministic when:

- Compliance dates are explicit in statute or regulation
- No extensions or waivers apply
- Calendar calculation is mechanical
- No discretionary determination is required

**Examples:**
- Annual report filing deadlines
- License renewal dates
- Statute of limitations expiration (when preservation is clear)

## 5. Contractual Performance Triggers

### 5.1 Numeric Conditions Precedent

Deterministic when:

- Contract language specifies exact numeric thresholds
- Triggering events are measurable without interpretation
- No performance standards requiring judgment
- Facts are explicit in the record

**Examples:**
- Payment due upon delivery of 1000 units
- Automatic renewal unless notice given 60 days prior
- Interest rate adjustment tied to published index value

### 5.2 Binary Contractual Conditions

Deterministic when:

- Condition is satisfied or not satisfied with no intermediate states
- No reasonableness standard applies
- No substantial performance doctrine applies
- Facts are undisputed

**Examples:**
- Certificate of completion issued or not issued
- Payment received or not received by specified date
- Notice delivered or not delivered

## 6. Jurisdictional Determinism

### 6.1 Geographic Jurisdiction

Deterministic when:

- Statute specifies exact geographic boundaries
- No minimum contacts analysis required
- No forum selection or transfer-of-venue discretion
- Facts establish location unambiguously

**Examples:**
- Federal jurisdiction based on federal enclave boundaries
- State jurisdiction based on county lines
- Venue based on explicit statutory designation

### 6.2 Subject Matter Jurisdiction

Deterministic when:

- Jurisdictional amount is explicit and undisputed
- No diversity of citizenship analysis required
- No supplemental jurisdiction determination
- Statute provides bright-line test

**Examples:**
- Small claims court jurisdictional limits
- Federal question jurisdiction for enumerated statutes
- Probate jurisdiction over decedent estates

## 7. Procedural Determinism Extensions

### 7.1 Filing Deadlines

Deterministic when:

- Deadline is numeric (days, months, years)
- No tolling provisions apply
- No equitable exceptions are invoked
- Filing date is explicit in the record

**Examples:**
- 30-day appeal deadline with no tolling
- 90-day notice requirement with no exceptions
- Annual registration deadline with no extensions

### 7.2 Service of Process Requirements

Deterministic when:

- Service method is mandated by rule
- No alternative service provisions apply
- Proof of service is explicit
- No jurisdictional challenge is raised

**Examples:**
- Personal service within state boundaries
- Service on registered agent of record
- Service by certified mail with return receipt

# PART III — CLARIFIED EDGE CASES

## 8. Preservation and Forfeiture

### 8.1 Explicit Preservation

Deterministic when:

- Objection was made on the record
- Objection identified the specific error
- No waiver occurred
- Appellate court has confirmed preservation

Nondeterministic when:

- Preservation is arguable
- Objection was general rather than specific
- Plain error doctrine may apply

### 8.2 Plain Error Doctrine

Always nondeterministic. Plain error requires:

- Discretionary determination of error obviousness
- Assessment of prejudice
- Balancing of fairness and finality

No deterministic path exists for plain error analysis.

## 9. Statute of Limitations Edge Cases

### 9.1 Deterministic Scenarios

Deterministic when:

- Accrual date is undisputed
- No tolling or suspension provisions apply
- Limitations period is explicit
- Filing date is undisputed

### 9.2 Nondeterministic Scenarios

Nondeterministic when:

- Discovery rule applies
- Continuing violation doctrine is invoked
- Equitable tolling is argued
- Fraudulent concealment is alleged

## 10. Harmless Error Boundaries

Harmless error is always nondeterministic except:

### 10.1 Structural Error

When appellate courts have explicitly classified an error as structural (automatic reversal), the determination that reversal is required is deterministic.

The identification of whether an error is structural remains nondeterministic.

### 10.2 No-Harm Scenarios

When the record explicitly shows:

- The error could not have affected the outcome (e.g., verdict was directed on other grounds)
- The party prevailed despite the error
- The error was invited by the party asserting it

The classification that no prejudice occurred may be deterministic if these conditions are undisputed.

# PART IV — EXPANDED REFUSAL CONDITIONS

## 11. Mandatory Refusal Scenarios

A deterministic system must refuse to produce output when:

### 11.1 Ambiguous Statutory Language

- Statute contains undefined terms requiring interpretation
- Legislative history conflicts
- Precedent is divided or absent

### 11.2 Fact-Dependent Standards

- "Reasonable" appears in the governing standard
- "Substantial" requires weighing
- "Material" requires contextual judgment

### 11.3 Conflicting Precedent

- Circuit splits exist
- State high courts disagree
- Overruling is anticipated or argued

### 11.4 Credibility Determinations

- Witness testimony conflicts
- Documentary evidence is disputed
- Intent or motive is at issue

### 11.5 Multi-Factor Balancing Tests

- No single factor is dispositive
- Weighting of factors is discretionary
- Courts have reached different outcomes on similar facts

### 11.6 Equitable Doctrines

- Laches, estoppel, or unclean hands are invoked
- Balancing of equities is required
- Fairness or justice considerations apply

### 11.7 Discretionary Standards of Review

- Abuse of discretion standard applies
- Clearly erroneous standard applies
- Substantial evidence review is required

### 11.8 Procedural Ambiguity

- Preservation is disputed

# PART V — INTERACTION WITH V1.0.0 DOCUMENTS

## 12. Hierarchy of Authority

The following order of authority applies:

1. **The No Fate Contract v1.0.0** — Defines core boundaries and prohibited conduct
2. **The Deterministic Map of Law v1.0.0** — Establishes domain-by-domain classifications
3. **This Supplement v1.1.0** — Extends and clarifies within the v1.0.0 framework

If this supplement conflicts with v1.0.0 documents, v1.0.0 controls.

## 13. Additive Clarifications

This supplement adds:

- New deterministic domains not enumerated in v1.0.0
- Edge case clarifications that refine v1.0.0 boundaries
- Additional refusal conditions that implement v1.0.0 principles

This supplement does not:

- Remove any v1.0.0 classifications
- Narrow any v1.0.0 refusal conditions
- Expand into nondeterministic territory

## 14. Preservation of Core Principles

All core principles from v1.0.0 remain intact:

- Determinism does not imply adjudication
- Refusal is correct behavior when determinism fails
- Human judgment cannot be automated
- Nondeterministic zones are essential to legitimacy
- Pre-adjudicative classification does not replace judicial authority

# PART VI — IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

## 15. Using This Supplement

### 15.1 Classification Workflow

When classifying a legal question:

1. Consult The Deterministic Map of Law v1.0.0 for domain classification
2. Apply The No Fate Contract v1.0.0 for boundary enforcement
3. Consult this supplement for extended classifications and edge cases
4. If any document requires refusal, refuse
5. If any ambiguity exists, refuse

### 15.2 Refusal Prioritization

If multiple refusal conditions apply, the system must:

- Identify all applicable refusal conditions
- Refuse to produce output
- Report which refusal conditions triggered

### 15.3 Boundary Disputes

If a boundary classification is disputed:

- Treat the question as nondeterministic
- Refuse to produce output
- Report the boundary dispute
